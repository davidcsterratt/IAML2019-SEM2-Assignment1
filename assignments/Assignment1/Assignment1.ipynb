    "\n",
    "**It is important that you carefully follow the instructions below for things to work properly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to set up and activate your environment as you would do for your labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the code/markdown cell where to put it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The .csv files that you will be using are located at `./datasets` (i.e. use the `datasets` directory **adjacent** to this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered with 2-3 lines of explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to distinguish between **attributes** (columns of the data) and **features** (which typically refers only to the independent variables, i.e. excluding the target variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer.\n",

    "### Description of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is based on the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. This dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware, comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale, soc.religion.christian). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three versions of the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. In this assignment we will use the `bydate` matlab version in which documents are sorted by date into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, newsgroup-identifying headers are dropped and duplicates are removed. This collection comprises roughly 61,000 different words, which results in a bag-of-words representation with frequency counts. More specifically, each document is represented by a 61,000 dimensional vector that contains the counts for each of the 61,000 different words present in the respective document. \n",
    "\n",
    "To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we preprocessed the original dataset. We will use documents from only 5 out of the 20 newsgroups, which results in a 5-class problem. The class is conveniently stored in the `class` column. More specifically the 5 classes correspond to the following newsgroups: \n",
    "1. `alt.atheism`\n",
    "2. `comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware`\n",
    "3. `comp.sys.mac.hardware`\n",
    "4. `rec.sport.baseball`\n",
    "5. `rec.sport.hockey `\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note here that classes 2-3 and 4-5 are rather closely related. Additionally, we computed the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) of each word with the class attribute and selected the some words out of 61,000 that had highest mutual information. For very sophisticated technical reasons (which you should know!) 1 was added to all the word counts in part 1. The resulting representation is much more compact and can be used directly to perform our experiments in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: The data was preprocessed by a very busy PhD student... and hence should never be taken to be perfect at face value!"
